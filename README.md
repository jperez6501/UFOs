# UFOs
## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to take a data from UFO sightings, formulate it onto a table on a webpage, and apply filters to be able to filter information. This allows up to look at information from the data for a certain date, city, state, country, and the shape of the sighting. 
### Results
#### * The first filter I applied was to see sightings occurring on the date of 1/1/2010.

#### * Next, I wanted to focus on just sighting that occurred on 1/1/2010 and in the state of California. Since the State of CA happens in the US, I do not need to filter by country.

#### * I noticed that el cajon appeared multiple times, so I added that city as another filter.

#### * Lastly, I wanted to focus on the sightings of a triangle. Now I can see that more than one sighting was reported on 1/1/2010 in El Cajon, CA and both witnesses saw a triangle.
