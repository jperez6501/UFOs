# UFOs
## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to take a data from UFO sightings, formulate it onto a table on a webpage, and apply filters to be able to filter information. This allows up to look at information from the data for a certain date, city, state, country, and the shape of the sighting. 
### Results
* The first filter that I applied was to see sightings occurring on the date of 1/1/2010. <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 10 21 27 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100246124/167301231-92d46098-887b-4604-9b22-5b425abe1163.png">
* Next, I wanted to focus on just sighting that occurred on 1/1/2010 and in the state of California. Since the State of CA happens in the US, I do not need to filter by country.<img width="1437" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 10 21 42 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100246124/167301422-833d2851-e2be-4aa0-88b7-fce4532e3343.png">
* I noticed that the city of El Cajon appeared multiple times, so I added that city as another filter. <img width="1436" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 10 22 08 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100246124/167301438-eb507131-59bd-4f8d-af79-e4e18e8effee.png">
* Lastly, I wanted to focus on the sightings of a triangle. Now I can see that more than one sighting was reported on 1/1/2010 in El Cajon, CA and both witnesses saw a triangle. <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 10 22 26 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100246124/167301446-20fbe889-93ff-4455-b475-3df1c1caba6a.png">
### Summary
* While it is great that the Webpage is able to filter, one drawback to our webpage is that we are unable to select multiple filters in one category. El Cajon, CA and San Diego, CA are an 18-minute drive from each other. There was also a UFO sighting on 1/1/2010 in San Diego, CA where the witness saw a triangle shape. These two sightings were probably the same sighting, but since we can only see one city at a time, this San Diego sighting could easily be missed.
* One additional recommendation to fix our website would be to add the capability to select multiple filters to a certain category. To be able to see sightings from multiple cities that happened on the same date since these sightings are happening in the sky and it is possible that witnesses from different cities are seeing the same sighting.
* The next recommendation to fix our website would be to add a filter for duration since the longer a sighting, the more credible the sighting is. That way a person can only focus on sightings that had a longer duration.
